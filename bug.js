This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native.  The issue stems from attempting to access AsyncStorage synchronously within a component's render method or other synchronous contexts.  React Native's AsyncStorage is asynchronous by nature, meaning it performs operations in the background and returns a Promise.  Trying to treat its response as if it were immediate leads to unexpected behavior, often manifesting as undefined values or blank screens.

```javascript
//Buggy Code
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const value = AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey'); // Incorrect: Synchronous access
    return (
      <Text>{value}</Text> // value will likely be undefined
    );
  }
}
```
